                <h1>File Management System Demonstration</h1>
                <p>This is a Python QT project that serves as a demonstration of a simple file management system using
                    PyQt5. The application provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for managing files, including
                    features such as browsing directories, creating, deleting, and renaming files, and viewing file
                    details.</p>
                <h2>Installation</h2>
                <p>To run this project, you need to install the required dependencies. You can use the following command
                    to install them using the provided <code>requirements.txt</code> file:</p>

                    <div >
                        <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </pre>

                <h2>Usage</h2>
                <p>To run the File Management System Demonstration, execute the following command:</p>
                <pre>
                    <div >
                        <div >

                </div>
            </div>
        </pre>
                <p>This will launch the application, and you will be able to interact with the file management features
                    through the GUI.</p>
